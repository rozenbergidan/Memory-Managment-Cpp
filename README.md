This is a project from the course "System programming" I have taken in my second year in Ben Gurion University.
It is a collaboration with Tsuri Farhana, we both contributed for this project.
The main goal was to practice memory management.
This project is about simulating the spread of a corona virus - and stopping the adhesive chain using different patterns.
